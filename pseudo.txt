1. An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.
 
START
Loop till the user enters zero
  Read the number from the user
  add the number to the list

when loop breaks,
 store the first number into max variable
loop till the end of the list
   if the number is greater than max
    overwrite value of max
    else 
    remain the max value same
when the loop breaks, print max value
END

2. An algorithm that reads an arbitary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average

START
Read the number of numbers user want to enter
store the value in a x variable
loop x number of times
  read the number from the user
  add the number to sum
when loop breaks, divide sum by x 
 store the value in average variable 
print average
END

3. An algorithm that reads a grocery list and print out the list(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

START
Read the grocery list from the user
sort the list in an alphabetical order
print the list.
END


4.START
  Read the two numbers from the user
  Add the numbers and store in S variable
  Divide S by 2 and store in A variable
  Muliply the two numbers and store in P variable
  Print S
  Print A
  Print P
  END
