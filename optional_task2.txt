Pseucode for the algorithm that asks the user for a number and stores the number in a variable called n. then the algorithm should calculate and print out first n numbers in the fibonacci sequence

START
Request the user to input a number
store the number into a variable called "n"
Initialise the variable called "i" to 0
Initialise the variable called "f0" to 0
Initialise the variable called "f1" to 1
if "n" is less than zero
 print please input a positive integer
if "n" is equal to zero 
 print 0
if "n" is greater than equal to zero
 print fibonacci series:
 loop until "i" is less than "n"
 print "f0" 
 add "f0" and "f1"
 store the added value into variable called "f2"
 now, change the value of "f0" to "f1"   
 change the value of "f1" to "f2"
 incriment the vaue of "i" by 1
END
