I am taking software engineering bootcamp, as I was always interested in solving problems with technical solutions. Prior to bootcamp, I didn't know much of programming languages, the bootcamp helped me in learning a programming language Python, which is one of the popular languages used to solve the problems technically, as it has the capability to integrate with several platforms, AI based programs uses Python, even in Gaming also Python can be useful. 
The bootcamp also helped to learn about version controlling and Git version control system.
